title: "Reverse Traceroute - Towards standards-based path visibility"
---

The network we envision for MAVERIC is characterized by dynamic changes. In particular,
the backhaul connectivity can be volatile, change over time and multiple technologies
are used to connect the RAN to the wider internet. In such dynamic settings, visibility
into the current state of the network is important. Therefore, we have defined and 
implemented a reverse traceroute mechanism, that helps us with identifying potential problems
in the network beyond what is available today. In order to have a broader availability
of this reverse traceroute facility, we have contributed our design to the IETF. You
can read up on our protocol design [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-heiwin-intarea-reverse-traceroute).
