The MAVERIC project develops a comprehensive system for pop-up mobile campus networks for 5G and beyond, focusing on autonomy, robustness and support for in-network computing.


A reliable, comprehensive and powerful network is the basis for
digitization. 5G, the fifth generation of the global mobile
communications standard, now enables new possibilities for production
sites and facilities, logistics systems and other relevant economic
areas by wireless, high-capacity and secure networking. In order to
support the utilization of the innovative communication technology,
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK) pushes the
joint development and testing of application-related solutions for
private 5G networks by a funding program for participants from
business and research.

The flagship project "Campus OS" started in the beginning of 2022 and
is supplemented by six satellite projects focusing on
industry-specific solutions for 5G campus networks in different fields
of application. In this context, Xantaro Deutschland, the NVL Group
and the two universities of Augsburg and Emden/Leer form the
consortium of project "MAVERIC" for the development of a middleware
solution for the automated utilization of edge resources in campus
networks. The official project start was April 1st, 2022; the joint
kick-off meeting takes place on April 7th in Hamburg.
