The whole MAVERIC consortium has met in Hamburg to kickstart the work towards our 
common goal: to make 5G campus networks a part of the ship-building process. Few of us
have seen live how ships are built, what constraints there are on the ship yard
and what 5G connectivity could achieve during the building process of a large ship. 
We had the unique opportunity to visit a yard, step on a ship that is in the process
of being built and to discuss with domain experts what they would like to do with
a 5G network on the yard and within ships. This was an interesting experience and
we all went home with lots of impressions, ideas, problems to be solved and energy
to solve them. We surely all agree: this is the start of something good.
