Now, that the project has a lot to demo and to show in terms of tangible 
project results, we have started an event series, where we attend road shows,
industry events, and workshops all over the place. And we are not quite done yet,
because outreach is an important part of our project's mission.

We kicked off the current series of events with attending the 
International Roadshow of the "Forum Digitale Technologien (BMWK)" in Amsterdam
from 30.9. - 3.10.24, 
with a particular focus on edge computing, anchoring around the Edge Computing Expo 
Europe 2024.

Right after that, we had the pleasure the be a part of the 
["Tage der digitalen Technologien"](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Veranstaltungen/2024/tage-der-digitalen-technologien-2024.html)
in Berlin 7.10. - 8.10.2024, having the opportunity to present our work and what an event it was.

With just a single day break, we presented our mobile 5G campus network at the [OITC Workshop](https://www.augsburg.tv/mediathek/video/ausbau-an-digitalisierter-produktion-soll-wirtschaft-ankurbeln/).

Next stop, Essen in November. Stay tuned.
