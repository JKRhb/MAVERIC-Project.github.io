title: "BMWK project \"MAVERIC\" to simplify the utilization of 5G in corporate networks"
---

***Xantaro Deutschland, the NVL Group with shipyard locations in both the
North Sea and the Baltic Sea and the Universities of Augsburg and
Emden/Leer are jointly running the research project "Middleware für
automatisierte Verwendung von Edge-Ressourcen in Campus-Netzwerken" of
the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
(Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz (BMWK)). The aim is
the application-oriented development of management software for 5G
technology in enterprise campus networks.***

A reliable, comprehensive and powerful network is the basis for
digitization. 5G, the fifth generation of the global mobile
communications standard, now enables new possibilities for production
sites and facilities, logistics systems and other relevant economic
areas by wireless, high-capacity and secure networking. In order to
support the utilization of the innovative communication technology,
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK) pushes the
joint development and testing of application-related solutions for
private 5G networks by a funding program for participants from
business and research.

The flagship project "Campus OS" started in the beginning of 2022 and
is supplemented by six satellite projects focusing on
industry-specific solutions for 5G campus networks in different fields
of application. In this context, Xantaro Deutschland, the NVL Group
and the two universities of Augsburg and Emden/Leer form the
consortium of project "MAVERIC" for the development of a middleware
solution for the automated utilization of edge resources in campus
networks. The official project start was April 1st, 2022; the joint
kick-off meeting takes place on April 7th in Hamburg.

## Demands on and through modern 5G technology

Although Germany is one of the pioneers in the use of private 5G
frequencies for so-called "campus networks", the number of private 5G
licenses allocated by the Federal Network Agency has been manageable
so far. A reason for this is that even if the possibilities of the
carrier-grade technology are extremely versatile in theory,
implementation, subsequent operation and management of the resources
of an owned 5G campus network require specialist knowledge and
technological know-how.

In addition, industrial applications such as the NVL shipyard
association cause additional challenges: large shipyards at several
locations, ship areas made of metal and mobility during different
construction phases and the associated changing Internet/WAN
connections via satellite, radio link, fiber optics, etc. form the
framework parameters for the campus network.


## Project MAVERIC: Technology development for the management of 5G campus networks

Together with Xantaro as a specialist in network technology and the
universities of Augsburg and Emden/Leer, NVL is therefore validating
the utilization of 5G technology under difficult conditions as part of
the MAVERIC research project using the example of their shipbuilding
environment. The focus is on the development of solutions for edge
computing and the intelligent management of connections to the
Internet/WAN as well as of 5G campus networks in general. The goal is
the development of a middleware platform that enables companies to
operate their own networks and applications independently.


## The BMWK funding program "Campus networks based on 5G communication technology – testing and implementation of campus networks from both the provider’s and user’s perspective"

The Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK) promotes
the development of cutting-edge digital technologies in and for
Germany as part of various technology programs. Against the background
of the government's declared goal of taking an international leading
role as a technology provider for everything to do with 5G and the
perspective successor 6G, the topic of 5G campus networks is a funding
priority. Thereby, BMWK is driving the increased implementation of
public 5G-based networks as well as the expansion and utilization of
private 5G campus networks for the economy. For further information
