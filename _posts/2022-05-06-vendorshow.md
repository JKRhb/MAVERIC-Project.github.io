The MAVERIC consortium met for a full day workshop at the University
of Applied Sciences Augsburg and invited a set of 5G hardware and
software vendors for presenting their solutions and roadmaps for 5G
campus networks. There are many things going on at different layers of
the system, and there is a lot of innovation in ORAN,
microserives-based core and application platforms, and orchestration
of large-scale deployments.
