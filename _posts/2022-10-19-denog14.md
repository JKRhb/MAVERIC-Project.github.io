Network operations is one of the core topics for the MAVERIC project. Some of the most valuable feedback we can get on our work is therefore from the operational community. That is why we are thrilled to be able to present our work on [reverse traceroute](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-heiwin-intarea-reverse-traceroute) at [DENOG14](https://www.denog.de/de/meetings/denog14/index.html) on the 15th of November.
