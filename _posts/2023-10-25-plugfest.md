title: "5G interop - Plugfest in Berlin"
---

The MAVERIC project took part in the Fraunhofer HHI-organized 5G campus network plugfest in Berlin. 
We are really happy with the results. Our network came up without issues, various modems and
smartphones connected, bandwith and latency measurements showed good results, too. Our edge use case
demonstrated that video processing on the edge provides good results as well. But, we also
learned that 5G campus technology has still some way to go and if you want to run such a network
in production, you will need best of breed debugging and troubleshooting tools and technologies.
