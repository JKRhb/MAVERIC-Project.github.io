Education and research are at the heart of every university. But universities also have a third
mission, which includes, amongst other things, the creation of start-ups. The University of
Applied Sciences Augsburg is no exception and every research project is evaluated for
potential ideas which could lead to the establishment of a successful enterprise. We believe
we have found something in the MAVERIC project, something the University of Applied Sciences
has worked on. To get some external feedback, we have entered the "Funkenwerk Award" competiton
and are more than happy to report that we [have won](https://www.tha.de/HSA-funkenwerk/Ausgezeichnet-Funkenwerk-Award-fuer-innovative-Gruendungsideen.html)! 

Stay tuned for more start-up news in the future.
