The MAVERIC project is supporting the [Campus OS Working Group 1](https://campus-os.io/ag-1/) (Technology Building Blocks, Catalogue
(RAN, Core, TSN, Localization) as a co-chair. Our project is a so-called satellite project around the two larger Campus OS lead projects. As part of our ongoing cooperation, we volunteered to help lead on of their working groups, focussed on architectural and solution building blocks, formalized in a common catalogue.

Looking forward to the cooperation!
