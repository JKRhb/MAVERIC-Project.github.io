excerpt: "Middleware for Automated use of Edge Ressources In Campus networks" 
---

The MAVERIC project will develop a mobile 5G campus network system with a special 
focus on automated deployment, monitoring as well as flexible and digitally 
sovereign in-network computing. 

The main use cases within the project are processes and tasks on ship yards. 
This environment is particularly harsh and has very high requirements regarding 
availability, security and confidentiality.
