title: "5G Equipment arrived at University of Applied Sciences Augsburg"
---

You can simulate and emulate a wide variety network functions, protocols and traffic, but nothing comes close to the real thing. As part of the MAVERIC project's work, we will deploy campus networks at three partner sites, one of which is the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg. After a thorough requirements phase, we published a public tender, picked our vendor and now the equipment has arrived. After unboxing - something that somewhat felt like a really geeky Christmas - we will build up or own 5G campus network, including a 5G mobile pop-up network.

Stay tuned!
