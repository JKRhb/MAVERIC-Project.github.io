This is probably our last [exhibition](https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Kurzmeldungen/Aktuelles/2024/FDT/20241126_Stuttgart_Arena2036.html) 
that we will attend while the MAVERIC project is running... and what an event it was. The location - Arena 2036 - in 
Stuttgart show-cased the latest and greatest in automation technology and we
had the opportunity to pitch MAVERIC's output and to demonstrate our mobile
5G campus network. New was, that our 5G drone flew up and down attached to a pole on our trailer
and visitors could fly it with a proper controller over 5G while the camera image
was transmitted (also over 5G), hopefully demonstrating why edge computing makes
a lot of sense in these senarios.
