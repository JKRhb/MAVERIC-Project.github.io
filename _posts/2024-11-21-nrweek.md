It was cold but that's to be expected in the middle of November in Essen. But the location
was impressive and the event was, too. We show-cased our 5G mobile campus network at the
[5G.NRWeek Jahreskonfrenz](https://5g.nrw/5g-nrweek-2024-jahreskonferenz/) and pitched the MAVERIC project on stage. 
Good conversations, interesting talks. 

Thanks a lot for having us!
