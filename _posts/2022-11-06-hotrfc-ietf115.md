title: "Supercharging Traceroute @ IETF 115"
---

In order to get the discussion going on our reverse traceroute proposal in the INTarea working group of the IETF, we presented our work at the HotRFC session during the IETF 115 meeting. You can find the slides [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/115/materials/slides-115-hotrfc-sessa-5-supercharging-traceroute).

Our presentation included a call for action! If you can host a reverse traceroute server or would like to use the client and send us its output, please contact us using the information provided in the slides linked above.
